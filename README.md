The main files that were presented in this talk were Generics.kt and Types.kt, the rest of the files are supporting examples or trivial code setup.

Logically, the information flow starts broadly in Types.kt and culminates more specifically in Generics.kt, so for our viewers at home, I'd suggest you read them in that order :)

Feedback welcome!
